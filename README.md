TL;DR: Simply do nothing, avoid almost all temptation to do ðŸ’© abstraction ðŸ’© unless absolutely necessary.

Goals:

* Make adding new services easy.
* Allow modifying / evolving any one of the services arbitrarily without incurring the need to modify another.

Code:

* Config file deserialization and Service state mutating won't exist in parallel.
* Service always read from config file, this single routine instead of two.

(1) Service configure GUI <-> (2) Service's config file <-> (3) Live Service Object

(1) shall never mutate (3).

construct (3) only according to (2).

(1) only write to (2).

* Service construction will be done on the consumer side to avoid sharing constructor
* Service can be cast to `Service`, which only has `speak` and destructor, since the consumer should not care anything else after construction.
* Services don't share global config, don't share config mechanisms.
* Does not assume services have any similarity other than the fact they may `speak`.
* Avoid any "abstraction" across services.

Rational:

* Services are different.
* Construction materials needed by services are different.
* Services on earth are limited, thus the boilerplate caused by fewer useless abstractions is also limited
* The consumer will use services incredibly creative in the future.
* Abstracting seemingly similar but different things will eventually blunder.
